Package users provide simulation procedure policy evaluation scenario, hypothetical treatment effect, estimation approach, simulation parameters. OPTIC package constructs simulations chosen simulation parameters estimators, returning summary statistics simulation’s performance. Currently, OPTIC developed policy evaluation scenarios following assumptions: confounding : confounding variables determine observations’s selection treatment. Treatment effects assumed constant rather time-varying. Concurrent policies: one additional policy co-occurs policy -interest.
