The `optic` R package helps you scrutinize candidate causal inference models using **your own** longitudinal data.

The recent Diff-in-Diff literature revealed issues with the traditional Diff-in-Diff model, but we found it very difficult to evaluate the relative performance of different causal inference methods using *our own data*. 

Thus, we designed a series of simulations [@http://zotero.org/users/3390799/items/ZNCVTPJF;   @http://zotero.org/users/3390799/items/V3Q6ARUA] to study the performance of various methods under different scenarios. Our publications to date include:

1. In @http://zotero.org/users/3390799/items/ZNCVTPJF, we use real-world data on opioid mortality rates to assess commonly used statistical models for Difference-In-Differences (DID) designs, which are widely used in state policy evaluations. These experiments demonstrated notable limitations of those methods. In contrast, the optimal model we identified--the autoregressive model (AR) model- showed a lot of promise. That said, don't just take our word for it - try it out with your own data and see how various approaches do relative to each other. See below for details.

2. In @http://zotero.org/users/3390799/items/V3Q6ARUA, we also demonstrate it is critical to be able to control for effects of co-occurring policies, and understand the potential bias that might arise from not controlling for those policies. Our package can also help you assess the impact of co-occurring policies on the performance of commonly-used statistical models in state policy evaluations.

Assessing those methods in a systematic way might be challenging, but now you can now use our `optic` R package to simulate policy effects and compare causal inference models using your own data.

The package supports the traditional two-way fixed effects DID model and the AR model as well as other leading methods like augment synthetic control and the Callaway-Santa'Anna approach to DID.

### Why `optic`?

`optic` is named after the **Opioid Policy Tools and Information Center (OPTIC)** project. The research was financially supported through a National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant (P50DA046351) to RAND (PI: Stein). 

## Installation

You will need [R (>= 4.1.0)](https://www.r-project.org) to use this package. You can install the `optic` R package from the `R` console:

``` r
# in the near future, you will be able to install from CRAN with
install.packages("optic")

# or install the development version from github:
# install remotes if needed
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("RANDCorporation/optic", build_vignettes = T)
```

## Usage

Please see the introductory vignette by running `vignette("intro_optic")` after installing the package. The vignette provides a working example using a sample `overdoses` dataset provided with the package. `optic` provides three main functions: `optic_model`, `optic_simulation`, and `dispatch_simulations`. Use `optic_model` to define model specifications for each causal model to be tested in the simulation experiment. Then, pass your models, your data, and parameters to the `optic_simulation` function, that specifies a set of simulations to be performed for each `optic_model` included in your `list` of models. Finally, use `dispatch_simulations` to run your simulations in parallel.
